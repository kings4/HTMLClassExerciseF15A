<h2>Welcome to my site.<br/>
Please come in and stay awhile.</h2>

<p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit.</p>
    <p>If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

<h3>Product of the Week</h3>

<h3>My guarantee</h3>
<p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it for a full refund. <strong>No questions asked!</strong></p>
